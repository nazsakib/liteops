* **🔓 The Transparent Backend:** Your app is powered by your own Google Sheets. You own every row, every customer, and every invoice - forever.
* **🔑 Zero Lock-In:** Even without the app, your business records remain accessible, editable, and portable in a standard spreadsheet format you already know.
* **💪 Dual-Interface Power:** Use the Flutter mobile app for lightning-fast entries in your shop, and Google Sheets on your desktop for deep-dive analytics and custom reporting.
* **📊 Free Database Forever:** Google Sheets is free. No monthly database fees. Ever.
